I normally use this to brown ground beef to use in tacos, but you can use it for pretty much anything. The pan doesn't need any oil since it has a non-stick surface. I never have a problem with anything sticking to skillet. It's so easy to wash too. It is very easy to wash the skillet since nothing sticks to the surface. You also don't have to worry about the finish coming off. I had mine for years, and no type of finish has started to chip from the skillet. <br><br><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6K2sH0tJ_Y">pampered chef seattle</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6K2sH0tJ_Y">pampered chef in seattle</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6K2sH0tJ_Y">pampered chef products in seattle</a><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6K2sH0tJ_Y">buy pampered chef products in seattle</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
